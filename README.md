# WiiDesktop Launcher

Transform your Windows desktop into a nostalgic and functional masterpiece with WiiDesktop Launcher! This custom application replicates the beloved visual experience of the classic Nintendo Wii home screen, allowing you to launch your favorite apps, games, and websites from beautiful, interactive "channel" tiles.

## ✨ Main Features

WiiDesktop Launcher is built for ultimate personalization. Nearly every aspect of the UI can be tailored to your liking, creating a desktop experience that is uniquely yours.

* **🎨 Easy Wallpaper Customization!**
  * Easily change your background to any image you like.
  * Save your favorite wallpapers directly in the app, making it simple to switch between them.
  * Adjust the wallpaper's transparency for the perfect look, or enable the "liquid glass" effect for the bottom ribbon to see it through the UI.

* **🎵 Full Sound Customization**
  * Personalize your experience by setting custom sounds for channel clicks, hovers, and even the application's startup chime.
  * Set your own background music to create the perfect ambiance.

* **🚀 Quick & Easy Channel Creation**
  * Make new channels in seconds. Use the built-in image finder to search a community-driven database for the perfect thumbnail, or upload your own.
