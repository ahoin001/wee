## üñ•Ô∏è Multi-Monitor Settings Guide

WiiDesktop Launcher includes comprehensive multi-monitor support, allowing you to customize your experience across all connected displays.

### **Accessing Monitor Settings**

1. **Open Settings**: Right-click on the Wii ribbon or use the settings button
2. **Navigate to Monitor Tab**: Click on the "üñ•Ô∏è Monitor" tab in the settings sidebar
3. **Open Monitor Settings**: Click "üì∫ Open Monitor Settings" to access the full monitor management interface

### **Monitor Detection & Management**

The app automatically detects all connected monitors and provides detailed information for each:

* **Monitor Information**: Resolution, position, and status (Primary/Current)
* **Real-time Updates**: Automatically detects when monitors are added, removed, or reconfigured
* **Visual Indicators**: Clear labeling shows which monitor is primary and which is currently active

### **Monitor Switching**

#### **Quick Actions**
* **Move to Primary**: Instantly move the launcher to your primary monitor
* **Move to Secondary**: Switch to the first secondary monitor
* **Move Here**: Click on any detected monitor to move the launcher there
* **Refresh**: Update monitor detection if changes aren't reflected

#### **Launch Preferences**
Configure where the launcher should appear when starting:

* **Primary Monitor**: Always start on the primary display
* **Secondary Monitor**: Always start on the first secondary display
* **Last Used Monitor**: Remember and return to the last monitor you used
* **Specific Monitor**: Choose a particular monitor by ID
* **Remember Last Used**: Toggle to save monitor preferences across sessions

### **Monitor-Specific Wallpapers**

One of the most powerful features is the ability to set different wallpapers for each monitor:

#### **Setting Monitor Wallpapers**
1. **Open Monitor Settings**: Go to Settings ‚Üí Monitor ‚Üí "üì∫ Open Monitor Settings"
2. **Find Monitor Section**: Scroll to "Monitor-Specific Settings"
3. **Select Monitor**: Each monitor will have its own settings card
4. **Set Wallpaper**: Click "Set Wallpaper" to choose an image for that specific monitor
5. **Clear Wallpaper**: Use "Clear" to remove the monitor-specific wallpaper

#### **How It Works**
* **Automatic Switching**: When you move between monitors, the wallpaper automatically changes to that monitor's specific wallpaper
* **Persistent Storage**: Each monitor's wallpaper is saved and remembered
* **Fallback Behavior**: If no monitor-specific wallpaper is set, the app uses the global wallpaper
* **Opacity & Blur**: Monitor-specific wallpapers support the same opacity and blur settings as global wallpapers

### **Monitor-Specific Settings**

Beyond wallpapers, each monitor can have its own settings:

* **Theme Settings**: Different themes per monitor (future feature)
* **Color Schemes**: Monitor-specific color preferences (future feature)
* **Custom Configurations**: Save monitor-specific UI preferences

### **Advanced Features**

#### **Hot-Plugging Support**
* **Automatic Detection**: When you connect or disconnect monitors, the app automatically detects the changes
* **Real-time Updates**: Monitor list updates immediately when configuration changes
* **Graceful Handling**: The app handles monitor changes smoothly without requiring restarts

#### **Monitor Metrics**
* **Resolution Changes**: Automatically adapts to resolution changes
* **Position Tracking**: Knows which monitor the launcher is currently on
* **Bounds Management**: Handles monitor positioning and overlapping

### **Troubleshooting**

#### **Monitor Not Detected**
* **Check Connections**: Ensure the monitor is properly connected
* **Refresh Detection**: Click "Refresh" in the monitor settings
* **Restart App**: If issues persist, restart the application

#### **Wallpaper Not Switching**
* **Check Monitor Settings**: Ensure a wallpaper is set for the target monitor
* **Verify Monitor ID**: Make sure you're setting wallpaper for the correct monitor
* **Clear and Reset**: Try clearing the wallpaper and setting it again

#### **Performance Issues**
* **Reduce Wallpaper Quality**: Use smaller image files for better performance
* **Disable Animations**: Turn off wallpaper cycling if experiencing lag
* **Monitor Count**: Very high monitor counts may impact performance

### **Best Practices**

#### **Wallpaper Management**
* **Consistent Themes**: Use wallpapers with similar themes for a cohesive look
* **Resolution Matching**: Use wallpapers that match each monitor's resolution
* **File Size**: Keep wallpaper files under 10MB for optimal performance

#### **Monitor Configuration**
* **Primary Setup**: Designate your main monitor as primary for consistent behavior
* **Remember Preferences**: Enable "Remember last used monitor" for convenience
* **Regular Updates**: Refresh monitor detection after major display changes

### **Technical Details**

The multi-monitor system uses:
* **Electron Screen API**: For monitor detection and management
* **Zustand State Management**: For monitor state and preferences
* **Persistent Storage**: Monitor-specific data is saved to local storage
* **Real-time Events**: Monitor changes trigger immediate UI updates

This comprehensive multi-monitor support ensures that WiiDesktop Launcher provides a seamless and personalized experience across all your displays! üéÆ‚ú®
