🎯 Project Brief: Nintendo Wii-Style Electron App Launcher for Windows 11

🧾 Project Title:
WiiDesktop Launcher

📝 Project Summary:
WiiDesktop Launcher is a custom Electron-based desktop application for Windows 11 that replicates the visual experience of the classic Nintendo Wii home screen. Users can configure and launch their favorite apps or games by clicking on interactive “channel” tiles, complete with sound effects, animations, and custom icons—creating a nostalgic, fun, and functional desktop experience.

🎯 Goals:
Recreate the Wii homescreen interface using React within an Electron shell.

Allow users to launch .exe files from “channels” on the screen.

Include animations and sound effects to enhance immersion (e.g., hover glows, click zooms, startup sounds).

Make the layout and paths to applications configurable.

Package it as a standalone desktop app.
